            I am a computer science student at Cavendish University Uganda. Currently Pursuing my Diploma in 
            Computer Science And IT. I am doing an interesting internship at young firm in Bugolobi.

            school studies of different levels. Am glad that my efforts have been noticed by my directors and 
            its their goal to see how they can prepare me for a successful career in this job proffession.
